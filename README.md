Public Transport Services Decentralized
=======================================
This is a first attempt to translate the Dutch OV-chipkaart
system to a smart contract based system.

**This could be beneficial to all involved parties, travellers, agencies and governments.**

This could be a first step in cross-border public transportation
using shared infrastructure, the smart contract blockchains.

It is dependent on Oracles (like every usable smart-contract based project) which inject public transportation movements
on the blockchain. This can already be built using NDOV sources.

More ideas:
- Using Public Transport Tokens, which equal to 1 km of movement in a vehicle
- Automatic refunds on delays, based on this token
- Using "colored" tokens allows purchase with local currencies and settlement between public transport agencies, thereby removing the hassle from individual travellers
