Public Transport Unit tokens
=============================

Proposal for Public Transport Unit (PTU), a decentralized virtual currency for public transportation.

**I do not think it is possible to organize this without centralized organizations. It should be noted that the goal is to create a seamless experience from the travellers side, not to create a fully decentralized infrstructure.**

The basic idea is that 1.000 PTU = 1.000 km.

Issuance of PTU
--------------
Everyone should be able to issue PTU, also individuals and potentially harmful organizations.

It is up to the actual public transport agencies to actually allow travel using tokens. To make this workable in practice, agencies should be able to identify where the PTUs were purchased and so be able to get paid accordingly. This can be done using registry organizations, governments can play a role in this.

Using digital signatures and the "color of the token" the source of PTU can be identified.

Travelling
----------
Before a traveller is allowed to use a public transportation vehicle, there should be sufficient PTU on the wallet to travel the longest journey possible.

Fee calculation
--------------------
When participating in a public transport journey, it should be transparent how the fees are calculated. The OV-chipkaart was based around the idea that you pay per km.

How will the smart contract know how to many PTU should be paid to an agency?

In my opinion there should be multiple oracles supplying this information, sources could include:
- location of traveller (using GPS in smartphone)
- static timetable of vehicle
- actual timetable of vehicle
- location of vehicle
- planned+actual route of vehicle

Wallet/Token store
------------------
The wallet or token store can be a smartcard, like the Dutch OV-chipkaart or the UK oyster card.
Because integrity is checked by the underlying infrastructure (blockchain), there is no need to distrust wallet owners.


For travellers
--------------
- Seamless experience, even cross-border
- Transparent billing
- Full control over your own information
- Automatic refunds possible
- "Anonymous" travelling still possible (just as pseudonymous as currently possible)
- No expiration of smartcards

For agencies
------------
- Seamless experience of travellers (higher customer satisfaction)
- Improved performance indicators
- Virtual currencies have much lower transaction costs (micro payments) and are much faster.
- Settlement between agencies is cheaper
- Lower IT infrastructure costs
